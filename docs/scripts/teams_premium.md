## Introduction
As knowledgworkers, meetings determine our day-to-day work. Ineffective meetings are a major challenge for most companies. There are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is that what was discussed in the meeting was inadequately recorded.
Our real work takes place after the meeting. We refer back to our notes for this. Often, however, there is a lack of a common understanding of what has been decided and which tasks need to be completed.
