## Introduction
As knowledgworkers, meetings determine our day-to-day work. Ineffective meetings are a major challenge for most companies. There are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is that what was discussed in the meeting was inadequately recorded.
Our real work takes place after the meeting. We refer back to our notes for this. Often, however, there is a lack of a common understanding of what has been decided and who is responsible for taking on which task.
### *What if an AI relieves us of the work of note taking and creates a uniform meeting protocol for all meeting participants?*
